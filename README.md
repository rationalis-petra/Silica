# Silica

Silica is a language developed for the Opal editor. The intent is to provide a
pure, strongly-typed functional langauge for writing extensible GUIs. Features

+ A Rich type system based on System FÏ‰, aiming for the haskell experience of
  'if it compiles, it works' and including some extra goodies like first-class
  ml-style modules.
+ Interactive Programming: like in lisp and other dynamic PLs, silica is
  designed for interactive programming: programs are developed iteratively by
  making modifications to running programs, allowing for instant feedback. This
  is particularly useful for GUI development.
+ Portability: Silica runs on all major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac,
  Windows). Unfortunately, mobile support is neither available nor planned.
