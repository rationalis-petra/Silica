# Sigil

Sigil is a langauges which fuses PL theory with practical language design. 
Features include:

+ Full type system. Sigil has a full, rich type system based on System FÏ‰, aiming
  for the haskell experience of 'if it compiles, it works', and with extra
  features like ML-style structs as first-class citizens.
+ Interactive Programming: like in lisp and other dynamic PLs, Sigil 
+ Great Portability: Sigil uses common lisp as a backend, meaning that (depending on
  implementation), you can run natively, on the JVM, embedded or even in the
  browser.
